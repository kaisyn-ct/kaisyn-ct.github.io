          <p>Regarding Certificates:</p>
          <ul class="c11 lst-kix_list_6-0 start">
            <li>Certificate will be
                given after successful completion of all mandatory assignments
                wherever applicable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>Regarding Medium of Instruction:</p>
          <p> The language of instruction will be
              decided based on majority request. Please note that since these
              courses are highly technical, &nbsp;most
              of the terminology will be in English 
              &nbsp;although the explanation of the concept can be in Marathi or
              Hindi or Gujarati. For those who are not familiar with English
              terms in Statistics, you will be given open resources in Marathi
              but you will need to put in your own effort to associate the
              meanings. The trainer will not spend more time in translating
              every term.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Regarding connectivity issues:</p>
          <ul class="c11 lst-kix_list_4-0">
            <li>  Sessions will
                not be recorded, hence please ensure that your internet
                connection is stable during the session and Laptop is fully
                charged. Your router should preferably be on inverter backup. If
                not, then please use a good bandwidth mobile hotspot or router.
               </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In case you are staying in an area with
              unstable connectivity, please arrange to reach another area with
              stable connectivity for the sessions.</p>
